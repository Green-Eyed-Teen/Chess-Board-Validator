# Chess Board Validator

**A position is valid as long as:**
- 1 King of both sides, white and black, is present on the board.
- Maximum 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops and 2 Knights from both sides.
- Any coordinate can't be used twice.

**How to Use**

- Step 1: Download the code. You'll see 2 files- main.py and in.txt
- Step 2: Open them both (I'd prefer a code/text editor like Vs-code or PyCharm).
- Step 3: Write the board coordinates in the **in.txt** file in this manner: **w/b (denoting white's or black's pieces) + K/Q/R/B/N + sqaure's coordinate**. For example: wKe1 says that the White king is on e1 square of the board.
- Keep both the files in the same directory and run the main.py file
- You'd see the output in the terminal :)

Hope you enjoyed the program :)
